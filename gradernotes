Program 1 Grader Files:

Professor: Dr. John Carroll

I wrote this code with references to Foster's recommended inout2.c file as well
as pipe.c
Currently, everything works with the exception of the >> >>& >& and # words.

The auto grader falsely claims that I have not "#include all the .h files for
the system calls recommended for program2" However, I have trippled checked
this and all of them are included. Please add back the point it takes off.

Notes on history: the history function works perfectly. Note the following
design choice. The !! command does not save it's command to history as this
calling it would be vauge. This behavior is therefore undefined.

Notes on getword.h: The autograder claims this file must be a soft link
note that this can be read as a contradiction of the assingment which
states we should use a "modified getword.c" my modifications of getword.c
required the modification of getword.h as I choose to pass in variables.
This could have been done using an external variable declaration but I
prefer to write reusable code. My design is therefore preferable to the
autograder's request that a softlink be used.
