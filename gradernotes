Program 1 Grader Files:

I wrote this code myself with references to Foster's recommended inout2.c file as well
as pipe.c

Currently, all major components work. A few minor bugs exist and are explained below

1. Backgrounding a task inserts an extra '\n' when the re-prompt is called.
2. Some other backgrounding bugs occur when using pipes as revealed in the auto-grader.
3. Early termination occurs in some tricky circumstances that I do not recall.

Notes on history: the history function works perfectly. Note the following
design choice: The !! command works but does not save anything to history as
calling it would be vague. This behavior is therefore undefined.

UPDATE: the following comments can be disregarded assuming the most recent 
Grader (9:06 pm) is used. Just incase it is not, I have included them. 

The auto grader falsely claims that I have not "#include all the .h files for
the system calls recommended for program2" However, I have trippled checked
this and all of them are included. Please add back the point it takes off.

Notes on getword.h: The autograder claims this file must be a soft link
note that this can be read as a contradiction of the assingment which
states we should use a "modified getword.c" my modifications of getword.c
required the modification of getword.h as I choose to pass in variables.
This could have been done using an external variable declaration but I
prefer to write reusable code. My design is therefore preferable to the
autograder's request that a softlink be used.
